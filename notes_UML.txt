CLASS
To model inheritance on a class diagram, a solid line is drawn from the child class (the class inheriting the behavior) with a closed, unfilled arrowhead (or triangle) pointing to the super class. 
italicized text - This indicates that the BankAccount class is an abstract class and the withdrawal method is an abstract operation.


ASSOCIATIVITY
A bi-directional association is indicated by a solid line between the two classes. 
A uni-directional association is drawn as a solid line with an open arrowhead (not the closed arrowhead, or triangle, used to indicate inheritance) pointing to the known class.


PAKAGES
Inevitably, if you are modeling a large system or a large area of a business,
some pakages can be connected with junction (+)


INTERFACES

AGGREGATION
Aggregation is a special type of association used to model a "whole to its parts" relationship. In basic aggregation relationships, the lifecycle of a part class is independent from the whole class's lifecycle.
you draw a solid line from the parent class to the part class, and draw an unfilled diamond shape on the parent class's association end

COMPOSITION AGGREGATION
the child class's instance lifecycle is dependent on the parent class's instance lifecycle
diamond shape is filled same as aggregation.

REFLEXIVE AGGREGATIONS
sam as assosiation also, a class can also be associated with itself, using a reflexive association
 This may not make sense at first, but remember that classes are abstractions.

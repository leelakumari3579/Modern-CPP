1) Programming expertise
    - AT LEAST ONE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
    - Ideally one OOP language, one scripting language 
        and one general pupose structureoriented language
        e.g: C/C++/Python
        e.g: Rust/Java/Python
        e.g: Rust/Kotlin/Pyhton

2) Linear Data Structures
    - stack, linkedlist, queue, vector, array, and their variations

3) Essential algorithms
    - writing code should be work for any other languages 
     (must not use shortcuts like predefined, language defined methods)

4) Operating system fundamentals
    - Galvin (book by this author)

5) Computer Networks
    - know how interlinked our code

6) Databases
    - learn atleast one SQL and NoSQL techniques
    - e.g: MySQL, MongoDB.....

7) Version Control
    - e.g: Git (branching, merge operations, trashing, cherry picking,
                indexing, commit, remote repository connect)

8) Command Line  
    - Essential utility commands of your OS
    - Integration of command line with your editor
    - understanding path, update, ......
    - e.g windows powershell, ...........

9) Non-Linear data Structures
    - trees
        - n-nary trees
        - complete trees
        - Binary search trees
        - AVL trees
        - Red_Blaxk trees
    - graphs
        - weight/cost
        - directed graphs
        - cyclic graphs
        - bidirected graphs

10) Ability to read Documentation
    - skimming/searching/identifying relevent
